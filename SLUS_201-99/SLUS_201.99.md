# SLUS_201.99:
 
This folder contains the [splat](https://github.com/ethteck/splat/) configuration to split the game binary file and join our reimplemented C code in. All output folders will be contained inside this folder for this version of the game.

You will need to include the extracted `SLUS_201.99` elf binary file from your legal copy of the NTSC-U release of the game in this folder. No assets will be provided, you must own the game and use the assets from your copy.
